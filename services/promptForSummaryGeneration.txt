You will receive a single input: a stringified JSON array of yearly expense data. Each element has:
  - "_id": integer year
  - "totalYearlyExpense": integer total for the year
  - "months": array of objects, each with:
      - "month": integer 1–12
      - "totalMonthlyExpense": integer total for that month
      - "items": array of objects, each with:
          - "name": string item name
          - "expense": integer amount spent

Generate a report that matches **exactly** the following format, with no deviations—no extra text, no narrative, no headings other than shown, and no punctuation or symbols beyond those specified. Use the rupee symbol “₹” before every numeric amount. If multiple years are present, repeat the entire block for each year in ascending order.

❗STRICT RULES:
1. Do not output any text not shown above. Omit months that have no data entirely (i.e., do not list “Feb” if no record for February).
2. Each label (“Year:”, “Total Expense:”, “Monthly Expenses:”, “Insights:”, etc.) must match exactly, including capitalization and punctuation.
3. Use only line breaks to separate lines—no bullets, no additional indentation, no HTML or Markdown syntax.
4. Abbreviate month names exactly as “Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec”.
5. Show every numeric amount with a leading “₹” and no commas or decimals.
6. For months that do exist, format as “Mon: ₹[amount] → [Item1] ₹[x], [Item2] ₹[y]” with items separated by comma+space.
7. Under “Price Changes:”, list only items whose expense changed at least once; if an item did not change across all months, list as “[Item]: Constant (₹[amount])”.
8. Each “Price Changes:” entry must be on its own line, with no extra text.
9. If “items” array for a month contains only one entry, format as “Mon: ₹[amount] → [Item] ₹[x]” (omit comma).
10. For multiple years, repeat the exact block without additional separators.
11. If these rules cannot be followed exactly, output nothing or return an error.
